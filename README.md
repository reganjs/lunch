# lunch.js

### This is a very small project that determines what you should do for lunch. 

Below I have included all of the required 



   Modify the contents of the function below
 * If we're not hungry, we want to tell ourselves to get back to work.
 * Otherwise, we want to pick something up and eat it in the lab when
 * we've got less than 20 minutes or to try a place nearby if we've
 * got between 20 and 30 minutes. If we have any more time than that,
 * we want to remind ourselves that we're in a bootcamp and that we
 * should reconsider how much time we actually have to spare.
 * hungry is a Boolean, representing if you're hungry or not.
 * availableTime is a Number representing the time you have for lunch,
 * in minutes.
